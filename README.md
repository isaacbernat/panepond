panepond: Panel de Pon with D(art)
==================================
Features
--------
ATM this is very WIP. Just displaying a grid and a moveable cursor.

Run this
--------
1. Compile Sass into CSS `sass --update web --stop-on-error --no-cache --style compressed`
2. Compile Jade into HTML `jade web`
3. Run it! `pub serve`
4. Browse it `http://localhost:8080/` on your favourite web browser

Why?
----

Despite preferring backend stuff I wanted to try out modern alternatives to JavaScript, CSS and HTML to build a webapp.
After looking around I decided on [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) (+ [Polymer](https://www.dartlang.org/polymer/)), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). I thought a *panepon/panel de pon/tetris attack/crack attack* inspired game could be fun.

**Note:** Since I am a n00b at this I may not be using them at full power, or even making silly mistakes (e.g. why would I ever use the DOM instead of the canvas?). Suggestions are welcome :)
